# Progress: Collector Business Plan Analyzer

## Current Status (As of: 2025-04-03 @ 22:19)

*   **Phase:** Phase 2 Implementation (Initial Component & State Setup)
*   **Overall Progress:** ~15% (Core structure and placeholders established)

## What Works

*   Project setup (Vite, TS, Git).
*   Core dependencies installed.
*   Redux store configured with persistence (`staff`, `stages`, `costs`, `financials` slices).
*   Basic MUI theme applied.
*   Routing between placeholder pages for all main modules.
*   Base Layout component with navigation.
*   ESLint/Prettier configured.
*   Type definitions created for Staff, Stages, Costs, Financials.
*   Placeholder components created for Staff (Table, Form w/ validation), Stages (Configurator, Visualizer), Costs (Table, Form w/ validation), Labor Cost (Display, Config, Visualizer), Financials (Portfolio Config w/ validation, Params Config w/ validation, Report, Scenario, Timeline).
*   Basic calculation utilities structure created (`calculations.ts`).
*   Application is runnable in dev mode (`npm run dev`).

## What's Left to Build (High-Level based on `restructured_tasks.md`)

1.  **Task 1:** ~~Project Setup & Architecture~~ (Completed)
2.  **Task 2:** Staff Management Module (Refine UI, implement edit/delete logic)
3.  **Task 3:** Collection Stages Module (Implement Configurator forms, Workflow visualizer, validation, dependency logic)
4.  **Task 4:** Labor Cost Calculation Module (Implement caseload logic, connect calculations, refine UI)
5.  **Task 5:** Cost Management Module (Refine UI, implement edit/delete logic)
6.  **Task 6:** Financial Modeling Module (Implement core calculations - CF, P&L, NPV, IRR etc., connect to UI, refine Scenario logic)
7.  **Task 7:** Dashboard & Visualization Module (Implement charts, display metrics, refine layout)
8.  **Task 8:** Testing (Unit, Integration, E2E)
9.  **Task 9:** Documentation (User & Technical)
10. **Task 10:** Deployment & Support

## Known Issues / Blockers

*   **MUI Grid Type Errors:** Persistent TypeScript errors related to MUI `Grid` component props (`item`, `xs`, `sm`) required using a workaround with `Box` and flexbox for layout in several components. The root cause seems to be a type definition conflict between MUI v7, React 19, and/or TypeScript v5.7.
